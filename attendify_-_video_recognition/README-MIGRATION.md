# This migration guide is no longer needed - staying with Convex

Your Attendify app will continue using Convex as originally designed. The MongoDB migration has been reverted.

## Current Architecture

- **Database**: Convex (real-time, serverless)
- **Authentication**: Convex Auth
- **File Storage**: Convex Storage
- **Functions**: Convex queries, mutations, and actions
- **Real-time**: Built-in with Convex

## Benefits of Staying with Convex

1. **Real-time by default** - No need for Socket.io or SSE
2. **Serverless** - No backend server to manage
3. **Type-safe** - Generated TypeScript types
4. **Built-in auth** - No JWT management needed
5. **Integrated file storage** - No need for Cloudinary/S3
6. **Simple deployment** - Single command deployment

Your app is ready to use as-is with Convex!
